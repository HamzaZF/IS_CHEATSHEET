Lecture 5:
- 0, 1 & 2: GPIO with ADC
- input.onPinPressed(TouchPin.P0, ()=>{}) (one finger has to be connected to GND pin)

Lecture 06:
- Raspberry has bi-directional GPIOs
- RPi.GPIO library
- Microbit : no need to specify input or output for gpio (we use WritePin and ReadPin) but in rasp we need to specify this
- Rasp's gpios are digital pins (low or high only). Need to use an ADC to read the value of analogue input devices such as potentiometers
- Rasp does not have an on-board ADC (microbit has one). Need to place MCP3008 ADC on the breadboard
- The analogue values are communicated to the Rasp using the SPI Protocol, need to enable SPI

Lecture 07:
- Don't forget to use version 2 of makecode and to disable pairing (enable "no pairing required") when you work with bluetooth
- Bluetooth UART allows to exchange a maximum of 20 bytes of data at a time in either direction

Lecture 08:
- 


Silhouette Score:

    - Closer to 1 → well-separated, dense clusters

    - ~0 → overlapping clusters

    - < 0 → points may be in the wrong cluster
